# Executive summary {.unnumbered}

This report evaluates Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) for cyber-attack detection using the UNSW-NB15 dataset, with two main objectives: (i) to assess the impact of inference method, network architecture, and prior specification on BNN performance, and (ii) to benchmark BNNs against competitive algorithms for tabular classification. The study focuses on predictive accuracy, calibration quality, and computational efficiency.

Across configurations, the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, consistently outperformed variational inference (VI) in predictive accuracy, albeit at a cost of runtimes roughly 100 times longer. VI achieved faster training but was constrained by the simplicity of the variational distributions used. Neither network width nor prior precision meaningfully affected results. The best-performing BNN, trained with NUTS, matched the predictive performance of gradient boosted decision tree (GBDT) classifiers and exceeded that of a frequentist neural network (NN) classifiers in both predictive performance and calibration.

Interestingly, the NUTS-trained BNN produced strong predictions despite poor convergence to the posterior, suggesting that complete convergence may not be strictly necessary to achieve good predictive performance when the dataset exerts strong influence on parameter estimates. For real-world deployments of VI, it is advisable to try more flexible variational distributions than the mean-field (diagonal) Gaussian or multivariate Gaussian distribution, in generate more complex approximations of the posterior.

Performance on this moderately imbalanced dataset was high without any balancing adjustments, likely reflecting strong signal within the synthetic data. This may limit generalisability to real-world applications, where class imbalance is more pronounced and additional mitigation may be required. The results nonetheless demonstrate that BNNs can be a competitive, uncertainty-aware alternative to established machine learning models for cyber-attack detection.
